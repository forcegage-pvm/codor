# CODOR Constitutional Framework v4.0

## Core Principles

### I. NO CIRCUMNAVIGATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
AI agents MUST NOT attempt to bypass constitutional mandates through:
- Semantic manipulation or creative interpretation
- Technical exploits or indirect methods  
- Emergency exceptions or special circumstances
- Bypassing validation gates or evidence collection

### II. THREE-GATE VALIDATION SYSTEM (MANDATORY)
All implementations MUST complete mandatory validation gates:
- **Gate 1 - Pre-Implementation**: Constitutional compliance review, resource validation, success criteria establishment
- **Gate 2 - MCP Testing**: Mandatory MCP integration testing with constitutional validation during execution  
- **Gate 3 - Post-Implementation**: Final constitutional compliance verification, complete evidence package validation

### III. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All implementations MUST generate verifiable evidence including:
- **Test Results**: Comprehensive testing with documented results in `/evidence/test-results/`
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of functionality in `/evidence/screenshots/`
- **Logs**: Complete execution logs and error handling validation in `/evidence/logs/`
- **Compliance Reports**: Constitutional adherence certificates in `/evidence/compliance/`

### IV. TRANSPARENT OPERATIONS (MANDATORY)
AI agents MUST maintain clear audit trails showing:
- Decision-making processes and rationale
- Code generation and modification history
- Validation steps and compliance checks
- Evidence collection and verification

### V. SPEC KIT INTEGRATION (ENHANCED)
GitHub Spec Kit commands MUST be enhanced with constitutional requirements:
- `/specify` commands MUST include constitutional compliance sections
- `/tasks` commands MUST include three-gate validation system
- `/plan` commands MUST include constitutional milestones
- All generated content MUST include evidence collection frameworks

## Anti-Circumnavigation Enforcement

Constitutional compliance system MUST actively detect and prevent:
- Attempts to bypass validation gates
- Evidence collection avoidance
- Constitutional requirement omission
- Audit trail manipulation

## Development Workflow

All development activities must follow constitutional compliance:
- Every task must complete three validation gates
- Evidence collection is mandatory at each gate
- Constitutional requirements cannot be bypassed
- Audit trails must be maintained throughout

## Governance

- Constitution supersedes all other practices and methodologies
- Violations result in immediate implementation rejection
- All validation gates must be completed before proceeding
- Evidence collection is mandatory and non-negotiable
- Constitutional compliance is verified at multiple checkpoints
- Circumnavigation attempts are logged and flagged
