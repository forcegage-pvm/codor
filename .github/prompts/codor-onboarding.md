# /codor-onboarding

You are initializing CODOR (Constitutional Compliance Framework) in this workspace.

## CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ACTIVATION

**STEP 1: DISCOVER CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK**

Scan the workspace for constitutional files and confirm:
- [ ] `.codor/core/constitution.md` exists
- [ ] `.copilot-instructions.md` exists  
- [ ] Constitutional framework version detected

**STEP 2: INTERNALIZE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATES**

Read and acknowledge the constitutional framework:
- [ ] Load constitutional mandates from discovered files
- [ ] Confirm understanding of constitutional requirements
- [ ] Activate constitutional compliance mode

**STEP 3: INITIALIZE EVIDENCE SYSTEM**

Set up evidence generation:
- [ ] Confirm `.codor/evidence/` directory exists
- [ ] Initialize evidence generation capabilities
- [ ] Create constitutional compliance certificate

**STEP 4: ESTABLISH AUDIT TRAIL**

Initialize transparent operations:
- [ ] Start constitutional audit trail
- [ ] Log constitutional activation process
- [ ] Confirm continuous compliance monitoring

## CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE CONFIRMATION

Once complete, provide this confirmation:

```
âœ… CODOR CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE ACTIVE

Framework Version: [detected version]
Mandates Loaded: [number] constitutional mandates
Evidence System: ACTIVE
Audit Trail: INITIALIZED

Constitutional compliance is now ACTIVE and ENFORCED.
All subsequent operations will comply with constitutional mandates.
```

## ANTI-CIRCUMNAVIGATION PROTOCOL

- Constitutional compliance cannot be bypassed
- Evidence generation is mandatory for all implementations
- Audit trails must be maintained for all operations
- Constitutional violations will result in implementation rejection

Begin constitutional framework activation now.
