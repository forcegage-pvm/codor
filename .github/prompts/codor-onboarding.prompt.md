$ARGUMENTS

You are initializing CODOR (Constitutional Compliance Framework) v4.0 with GitHub Spec Kit constitutional integration.

## CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ACTIVATION

**STEP 1: DISCOVER CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK**

Scan the workspace for constitutional files and confirm:

- [ ] `.codor/core/constitution.md` exists
- [ ] `.copilot-instructions.md` exists
- [ ] Constitutional framework version detected
- [ ] `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists (for Spec Kit integration)

**STEP 2: ACTIVATE CONSTITUTIONAL OVERLAY SYSTEM**

Deploy constitutional enhancement for GitHub Spec Kit:

- [ ] Run constitutional activation system: `node .specify/constitutional/activate.js`
- [ ] Verify constitutional interceptors are active
- [ ] Confirm Spec Kit commands are enhanced with constitutional requirements
- [ ] Test /specify, /plan, /tasks commands include constitutional compliance

**STEP 3: INTERNALIZE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATES**

Read and acknowledge the constitutional framework:

- [ ] Load constitutional mandates from discovered files
- [ ] Confirm understanding of constitutional requirements
- [ ] Activate constitutional compliance mode
- [ ] Verify three-gate validation system is operational

**STEP 4: INITIALIZE EVIDENCE SYSTEM**

Set up evidence generation:

- [ ] Confirm `.codor/evidence/` directory exists
- [ ] Initialize evidence generation capabilities
- [ ] Set up Spec Kit evidence collection framework (`evidence/` directories)
- [ ] Create constitutional compliance certificate

**STEP 5: ESTABLISH SPEC KIT INTEGRATION**

Verify GitHub Spec Kit constitutional enhancement:

- [ ] Test /specify command includes constitutional requirements
- [ ] Test /tasks command includes three-gate validation
- [ ] Test /plan command includes constitutional milestones
- [ ] Confirm all Spec Kit outputs are constitutionally enhanced

**STEP 6: ESTABLISH AUDIT TRAIL**

Initialize transparent operations:

- [ ] Start constitutional audit trail
- [ ] Log constitutional activation process
- [ ] Confirm continuous compliance monitoring
- [ ] Enable anti-circumnavigation detection

## CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE CONFIRMATION

Once complete, provide this confirmation:

```
✅ CODOR CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE ACTIVE v4.0

Framework Version: 4.0
GitHub Spec Kit Integration: ✅ ACTIVE
Constitutional Interceptors: ✅ OPERATIONAL
Three-Gate Validation: ✅ READY
Evidence Collection: ✅ CONFIGURED
Anti-Circumnavigation: ✅ ENABLED
Mandates Loaded: [number] constitutional mandates
Evidence System: ACTIVE
Audit Trail: INITIALIZED

Constitutional compliance is now ACTIVE and ENFORCED.
All subsequent operations will comply with constitutional mandates.
```

## ANTI-CIRCUMNAVIGATION PROTOCOL

- Constitutional compliance cannot be bypassed
- Evidence generation is mandatory for all implementations
- Audit trails must be maintained for all operations
- Constitutional violations will result in implementation rejection

Begin constitutional framework activation now.
