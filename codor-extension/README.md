# CODOR VS Code Extension

**AI Agent Task Manager & Quality Gate for Specification-Driven Development**

## Overview

CODOR Extension is a VS Code extension that acts as an authoritative task manager and quality gate for AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot Workspace, Cursor, etc.) implementing tasks from GitHub Spec Kit.

**Key Innovation:** Instead of letting AI agents freely access `tasks.md` files (leading to drift and fabrication), CODOR intercepts task generation at the source, stores tasks in a SQLite database, and exposes only one task at a time through a controlled UI.

## Core Features

- âœ… **Spec Kit Augmentation**: Minimal patches to Spec Kit scripts to emit tasks directly to CODOR
- âœ… **Database-Driven Task Management**: Tasks stored in SQLite, never exposed as `tasks.md`
- âœ… **UI Task Queue**: Tree view showing features, specs, plans, and current task only
- âœ… **Verification Gates**: Automatically verify task completion against requirements
- âœ… **AI Agent Control**: Force AI agents to follow task order and meet acceptance criteria
- âœ… **Evidence Collection**: Track test results, failures, and technical debt
- âœ… **Git-Friendly**: Spec/plan files remain as markdown for version control

## Architecture

```
CODOR Extension (Hybrid Approach)
â”œâ”€â”€ Spec Kit (Minimal Patches)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Generates spec.md/plan.md (as files)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Emits tasks to CODOR database (not tasks.md)
â”œâ”€â”€ Task Database (SQLite)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Features, specs, plans, tasks
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Committed to git for team sync
â”œâ”€â”€ UI Components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Features Tree View
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task Queue (current task only)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task Details Webview
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Evidence Viewer
â””â”€â”€ Verification Engine
    â”œâ”€â”€ Run CODOR tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ Check acceptance criteria
    â””â”€â”€ Collect evidence
```
