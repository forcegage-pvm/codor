# CODOR VS Code Extension

**AI Agent Task Manager & Quality Gate for Specification-Driven Development**

## Overview

CODOR Extension is a VS Code extension that acts as an authoritative task manager and quality gate for AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot Workspace, Cursor, etc.) implementing tasks from GitHub Spec Kit.

## Core Features

- ‚úÖ **Task Management**: Import and manage tasks from Spec Kit `tasks.md`
- ‚úÖ **Verification Gates**: Automatically verify task completion against requirements
- ‚úÖ **AI Agent Control**: Force AI agents to follow task order and meet acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ **Evidence Collection**: Track test results, failures, and technical debt
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch file changes and auto-verify on completion

## Architecture

```
CODOR Extension
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task Database (SQLite)           # Authoritative task storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Spec Kit Parser                  # Import from tasks.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task Manager                     # Get next task, verify completion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Verification Engine              # Run CODOR tests, check requirements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ File Watcher                     # Monitor code changes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UI Components                    # Tree view, status bar, webview
```
