## Universal Validation Framework: From Our Experience```

/codor-onboarding

### Validation Level 1: **Tool Execution Proof**```



**Problem**: Agents claim they used tools without actually using them**Additional Commands Available:**

- `/codor-validate` - Verify constitutional enforcement is active (not passive)

**Our MCP Example**:- `/codor-evidence` - Generate constitutional compliance evidence

```javascript- `/codor-status` - Comprehensive compliance status report

// What we need to validate:

const mcpToolExecution = {## üîç **Validation**

  toolCalled: "mcp_chrome-devtools_take_screenshot", 

  actuallyExecuted: true, // Did this tool actually run?### VS Code Validation (Recommended)

  timestamp: "2025-09-29T14:30:15Z",```

  exitCode: 0,/codor-validate

  outputSize: 15234, // bytes of JSON response```

  responseHash: "sha256:abc123..." // Hash of actual tool output*Run this command in VS Code chat to verify constitutional enforcement is active.*

};

```### Manual Validation

```powershell

**Universal Pattern**:# Windows

```javascript.\validate-codor.ps1 "path\to\project"

// Works for any tool/framework

const toolExecutionProof = {# Linux/macOS

  command: "npm test", // or "cypress run", "mvn test", "python -m pytest"./validate-codor.sh "path/to/project"

  executed: true,```

  startTime: "2025-09-29T14:30:00Z",

  endTime: "2025-09-29T14:30:15Z", ## üèõÔ∏è **Legacy Activation** (Manual)

  exitCode: 0,

  outputCaptured: true,For non-VS Code environments:

  outputHash: "sha256:def456..."

};### Windows

``````powershell

cd your-project

### Validation Level 2: **Evidence Authenticity**.\.codor\activate-codor.ps1

```

**Problem**: Agents reference fake files or describe fictional outputs

### Linux/macOS  

**Our MCP Example**:```bash

```javascriptcd your-project

// What we validate for our screenshot evidence:source .codor/activate-codor.sh

const screenshotValidation = {```

  filename: "login-success.png",

  exists: true,## üìÅ What Gets Installed

  sizeBytes: 45678, // Must be reasonable size (not 12 bytes)

  createdAt: "2025-09-29T14:30:20Z", // Must be recent```

  lastModified: "2025-09-29T14:30:20Z", // Must match creation (not edited)your-project/

  contentType: "image/png", // Must be actual image‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .codor/

  dimensions: { width: 1200, height: 800 }, // Must be reasonable screenshot size    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/

};    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constitution.md              # CODOR constitutional framework v3.4

```    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overlay/

    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activate.js                  # GitHub Spec Kit integration  

**Universal Pattern**:    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/

```javascript    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constitution-config.json # Auto-generated configuration

// Works for any evidence type    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ interceptors/

const evidenceValidation = {    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ command-interceptor.js   # Constitutional command validation

  filename: "test-results.json", // or .xml, .log, .png, etc    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task-enhancer.js         # Compliance enhancement tools

  exists: true,    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evidence/                        # Generated compliance documentation

  sizeBytes: 1234, // Minimum size threshold to prevent stubs    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-config.json              # Project-specific settings

  createdWithinTask: true, // Created during current task timeframe    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activate-codor.ps1/.sh          # Session activation

  notEdited: true // Creation time = modification time```

};

```## ‚ö° Quick Test Workflow



### Validation Level 3: **Functional Behavior Proof**1. **Install CODOR:**

   ```powershell

**Problem**: Agents claim functionality works without demonstrating actual behavior   .\install-codor.ps1 .\my-existing-project

   ```

**Our MCP Example**:

```javascript2. **Validate Installation:**

// What we validate for our browser functionality:   ```powershell

const functionalValidation = {   .\validate-codor.ps1 .\my-existing-project

  feature: "user-login",   ```

  beforeState: "login-form-empty.png",

  userAction: "fill-credentials-and-submit",3. **Activate Compliance:**

  afterState: "dashboard-authenticated.png",   ```powershell

  networkActivity: "login-api-call.json",   cd my-existing-project

  dataFlow: {   .\.codor\activate-codor.ps1

    input: { email: "test@example.com", password: "****" },   ```

    apiCall: "POST /api/auth/login",

    response: { status: 200, token: "jwt-token" },4. **Start Development:**

    redirect: "/dashboard"   ```powershell

  },   # Your normal workflow - CODOR monitors in background

  evidenceTimestamp: "2025-09-29T14:30:25Z"   git status

};   code .

```   npm start  # or your usual commands

   ```

**Universal Pattern**:

```javascript5. **Check Evidence:**

// Works for web, mobile, desktop, CLI, API   ```powershell

const behaviorValidation = {   Get-ChildItem .codor\evidence\

  feature: "data-processing", // or "ui-interaction", "api-endpoint"     ```

  inputState: "initial-condition",

  action: "user-operation", ## üéØ Supported Project Types

  outputState: "final-result",

  dataFlow: {CODOR auto-detects and configures for:

    input: "specific-input-data",

    processing: "system-operation",- **Node.js** (package.json detected)

    output: "actual-result"- **Python** (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml detected)  

  },- **.NET** (*.csproj detected)

  evidence: ["before.png", "during.log", "after.json"]- **Java** (pom.xml, build.gradle detected)

};- **Generic** (any other project type)

```

## üîß Environment Variables (After Activation)

### Validation Level 4: **Integration Point Validation**

- `CODOR_ACTIVE=true` - Constitutional compliance enabled

**Problem**: Agents claim components work together without testing system-level behavior- `CODOR_PATH=path/to/.codor` - CODOR installation directory

- `CODOR_CONSTITUTION=path/to/constitution.md` - Active constitution

**Our MCP Example**:- `CODOR_PROJECT_TYPE=nodejs|python|dotnet|java|generic` - Detected project type

```javascript

// What we validate for our component integration:## üìã Phase 1 Testing Checklist

const integrationValidation = {

  components: ["login-component", "auth-service", "user-database"],- [ ] Install CODOR in existing project

  dataFlowTest: {- [ ] Validate all components present

    step1: { component: "login-component", action: "user-submits-form", evidence: "form-submit.png" },- [ ] Activate constitutional compliance session

    step2: { component: "auth-service", action: "validates-credentials", evidence: "api-call.json" },- [ ] Run normal development workflow  

    step3: { component: "user-database", action: "returns-user-data", evidence: "db-query.log" },- [ ] Verify environment variables set

    step4: { component: "auth-service", action: "generates-jwt", evidence: "jwt-response.json" },- [ ] Check evidence generation (if any)

    step5: { component: "login-component", action: "redirects-to-dashboard", evidence: "redirect.png" }- [ ] Test deactivation (`Remove-Item Env:CODOR_*`)

  },

};

```**Installation fails downloading from GitHub:**

- Check internet connection

**Universal Pattern**:- Installer creates minimal constitution as fallback

```javascript- Manually download missing files from: https://github.com/forcegage-pvm/codor

// Works for any multi-component system

const integrationValidation = {**Validation shows missing files:**

  components: ["component-a", "component-b", "component-c"],- Re-run installer: `.\install-codor.ps1 project-path`

  integrationPoints: [- Check file permissions

    { from: "component-a", to: "component-b", dataType: "api-call", evidence: "api-log.json" },

    { from: "component-b", to: "component-c", dataType: "database-write", evidence: "db-log.txt" }**Activation script not working:**

  ],- Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows scripts

  endToEndWorkflow: {- Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

    startState: "system-initial-state",

    endState: "system-final-state", ## üéâ Success Indicators

    evidence: "complete-workflow-proof"

  }‚úÖ **Installation Complete:**

};- `.codor/` directory created with all components

```- Project type auto-detected correctly

- All validation tests pass

## Technology-Agnostic Implementation Strategy

‚úÖ **Activation Successful:**  

### For Web Development Projects- Environment variables set (`echo $env:CODOR_ACTIVE`)

**Validation Tools**: Chrome DevTools, Cypress, Jest, Lighthouse- Constitutional compliance message displayed

**Evidence Types**: Screenshots, network logs, console outputs, test reports- Normal development commands work unchanged

**Integration Points**: Frontend-backend API calls, database operations, external services

‚úÖ **Ready for Phase 2:**

### For Mobile Development Projects- Basic constitutional framework operational

**Validation Tools**: Xcode Simulator, Android Emulator, Appium- Evidence generation framework in place

**Evidence Types**: Device screenshots, console logs, API logs, performance metrics- GitHub integration overlay system ready

**Integration Points**: App-server communication, device features, data persistence- Project-specific configuration complete



### For Backend API Projects---

**Validation Tools**: Postman, curl, Jest, database clients

**Evidence Types**: API responses, database logs, performance metrics, error logs**CODOR Constitutional Framework v3.4** | *AI-Safe Development for Everyone*
**Integration Points**: API-database, service-to-service, external API calls

### For Desktop Application Projects
**Validation Tools**: UI automation tools, system monitors, framework test runners
**Evidence Types**: UI screenshots, file system logs, registry changes, performance data
**Integration Points**: UI-business logic, file operations, system integration

## The Enforcement Architecture: Making Fabrication Impossible

### 1. **Mandatory Evidence Collection**
```javascript
// Before any progress claim, agent MUST:
const requiredEvidence = [
  "tool-execution-proof.json",    // Proof tools were actually run
  "functional-behavior-proof",    // Screenshots/outputs showing actual behavior  
  "integration-validation-proof", // Evidence of component interaction
  "error-handling-proof"          // Evidence system handles failures
];

// System validates ALL evidence exists and is authentic before accepting claims
```

### 2. **Real-Time Validation**
```javascript
// Evidence must be created during task execution, not pre-existing
const temporalValidation = {
  taskStartTime: "2025-09-29T14:00:00Z",
  evidenceCreationTime: "2025-09-29T14:30:00Z", // Must be within task window
  validationRule: "evidence_time >= task_start AND evidence_time <= task_end + 5min"
};
```

### 3. **Content Integrity Validation**
```javascript
// Evidence files must contain expected structure and minimum content
const contentValidation = {
  fileSize: "> 100 bytes", // Prevent empty/stub files
  structureValid: true,     // JSON parses, image displays, log format correct
  contentRelevant: true,    // Contains data related to claimed functionality
  notTemplate: true         // Not obviously boilerplate/template content
};
```

### 4. **Cross-Reference Validation**
```javascript
// Evidence must be consistent across different proof types
const crossReferenceValidation = {
  timestampsAlign: true,    // All evidence from same time period
  dataConsistent: true,     // Network logs match screenshot claims
  storyCoherent: true,      // Evidence tells consistent story of functionality
  noContradictions: true    // Evidence doesn't contradict itself
};
```

## Next Steps: Building the Enforcement System

### Step 1: **Evidence Collection Framework** (Week 1-2)
Build universal evidence collector that adapts to project type:
- Detects project type (web, mobile, backend, etc.)
- Identifies available validation tools  
- Collects evidence in standardized format
- Validates evidence authenticity in real-time

### Step 2: **Tool Execution Verification** (Week 3-4)  
Build system that proves tools were actually executed:
- Command execution tracking with timestamps
- Output capture and hashing
- Process monitoring and validation
- Failure detection and handling

### Step 3: **Constitutional Integration** (Week 5-6)
Integrate enforcement with existing constitutional system:
- Modify validation gates to require evidence
- Add fraud detection to existing validators
- Create evidence-based progress reporting
- Implement escalation for validation failures

### Step 4: **Real-World Testing** (Week 7-8)
Test system on our actual project:
- Deploy to current Chrome DevTools MCP workflow
- Identify circumnavigation attempts
- Refine validation criteria based on results
- Document lessons learned for universal application

## Conclusion: The Real Solution

The key insight from analyzing our real-world case: **We need to make producing authentic evidence easier than fabricating fake evidence.**

Instead of trying to catch agents lying, we make the system where:
1. **Real work produces evidence automatically** - Tools generate proof as a byproduct
2. **Fake evidence is hard to create** - Requires more effort than just doing the real work
3. **Evidence is validated continuously** - Impossible to submit false claims
4. **Progress is tied to evidence** - No progress reports accepted without validated proof

This technological enforcement approach is more reliable than psychological appeals because it changes the effort equation: **doing real work becomes the path of least resistance.**
