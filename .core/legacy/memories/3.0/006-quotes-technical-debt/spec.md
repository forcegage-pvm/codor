## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a sales manager, I need the quotes management system to work reliably and completely so I can manage quotes, track status changes, convert quotes to invoices, and export data for reporting. Currently, many quote actions appear to work but actually do nothing, creating confusion and blocking business operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Core Functionality Restoration
1. **Given** I am viewing a quote in the list, **When** I click "Edit" action, **Then** I am navigated to the quote composer with that quote loaded for editing (not console.log)

2. **Given** I want to create a new quote, **When** I click "New Quote" button, **Then** I am navigated to the quote composer with a blank quote form (navigation currently commented out)

3. **Given** I have a successful quote to replicate, **When** I click "Duplicate" on a quote, **Then** a new quote is created via API with the same items and customer (not console.log placeholder)

4. **Given** I need to convert an approved quote, **When** I click "Convert to Invoice", **Then** the quote is converted via API and linked invoice is created (not console.log placeholder)

5. **Given** I need to update quote status, **When** I change status via dropdown, **Then** the status is updated via API and visual indicators reflect the change (not console.log placeholder)

#### Missing Features Implementation
6. **Given** I need to filter quotes by date range, **When** I use date range picker, **Then** only quotes within that date range are displayed (currently missing)

7. **Given** I need to export quotes for reporting, **When** I select individual quote for PDF or multiple quotes for Excel export, **Then** appropriate format is generated with relevant data (currently missing)

8. **Given** I have multiple quotes selected, **When** I choose bulk actions, **Then** selected quotes are processed with progress bar, cancel option, and completion notification (selection works, execution missing)

9. **Given** I want to quickly preview a quote, **When** I hover or click preview, **Then** a quick preview modal shows quote details without navigation (currently missing)

10. **Given** I need to search by specific criteria, **When** I search by quote number or customer, **Then** results show matching quotes only (currently basic text search only)

### Edge Cases
- **Broken functionality masquerading as working**: Users click buttons that appear functional but only log to console
- **Navigation dead-ends**: Quote composer routes exist but navigation is commented out
- **Incomplete workflows**: Quote selection works but bulk operations don't execute
- **Missing export system**: No way to generate reports or share quote data externally
- **Limited search capability**: Cannot find quotes by specific business criteria
- **Performance degradation**: System not tested with realistic quote volumes (1,000+ quotes) and lacks progressive loading patterns

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements - Critical Fixes (P0)
- **FR-001**: Quote actions (Edit, Duplicate, Convert, Archive) MUST execute actual business logic instead of console.log placeholders
- **FR-002**: Quote composer navigation MUST work for both new quote creation and existing quote editing
- **FR-003**: All quote operations MUST integrate with existing API endpoints, allow access for all authenticated users, and handle errors gracefully
- **FR-004**: Quote status updates MUST persist via API and reflect immediately in UI visual indicators
- **FR-005**: Loading states MUST be shown during all asynchronous quote operations
### Functional Requirements - Missing Features (P1)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide date range filtering for quotes with preset ranges (Today, This Week, This Month)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support PDF export for individual quotes and Excel export for bulk quote lists with summary data
- **FR-008**: System MUST execute bulk operations (status updates, archive, export) on selected quotes with simple progress bar, cancel option, and completion notification
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide quick preview functionality for quotes without full navigation
- **FR-010**: Search functionality MUST support quote number and customer name specific searches
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle realistic quote volumes (1,000+ quotes) using progressive loading with skeleton states while maintaining 100ms response times for all user interactions

### Functional Requirements - User Experience (P2)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for power users (Ctrl+N new quote, Ctrl+E edit, Ctrl+D duplicate, Ctrl+F search)
- **FR-013**: Error handling MUST provide user-friendly messages, specific error details, and retry options for each operation type
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all quote interactions
- **FR-015**: Mobile responsiveness MUST be tested and functional for quote management workflows
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide quote status updates visible on page refresh or via manual refresh button when multiple users are active

### Functional Requirements - Technical Debt (P3)
- **FR-017**: All quote components MUST achieve LEVEL 4+ constitutional completion levels
- **FR-018**: Test coverage MUST be ‚â•90% for all quote functionality with integration tests
- **FR-019**: Bundle size optimization MUST be implemented to prevent performance degradation
- **FR-020**: Audit logging MUST be implemented for all quote status changes and operations
- **FR-021**: Data validation MUST be consistent between frontend and backend with proper error reporting

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: When users export quotes for reporting, what specific file formats and data scope are needed for business operations? ‚Üí A: PDF for individual quotes only, Excel for bulk quote lists
- Q: For quote status updates and operations, what is the expected user authorization model? ‚Üí A: Open access: All authenticated users can perform all quote operations
- Q: For performance requirements with 1,000+ quotes, what is the acceptable user experience for initial page load versus subsequent operations? ‚Üí A: Progressive loading with skeleton states, 100ms response maintained
- Q: For bulk operations (status updates, archive, export), what is the expected user feedback and control during processing? ‚Üí A: Simple progress bar with cancel option and completion notification
- Q: For real-time updates when multiple users are active (FR-017), what is the business priority and technical scope? ‚Üí A: Medium priority: Updates visible on page refresh or manual refresh button

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Quote Management System**: Complete ecosystem requiring functional restoration of broken placeholder implementations, missing feature additions, and technical debt resolution to achieve business-ready state
- **Quote Actions**: Individual operations (Edit, Duplicate, Convert, Archive) that currently use console.log placeholders instead of actual business logic
- **Quote Navigation**: Route integration between quote list and quote composer that exists but is commented out/non-functional
- **Quote Export System**: Missing functionality for generating PDF and Excel exports of quote data for reporting and sharing
- **Quote Bulk Operations**: Partial implementation where selection mechanism works but execution of bulk actions is missing
- **Quote Search & Filtering**: Limited implementation requiring enhancement with date range filtering and specific search criteria
- **Quote Performance & Accessibility**: Technical debt requiring optimization for larger datasets and compliance validation
