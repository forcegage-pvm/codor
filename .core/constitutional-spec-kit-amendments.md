# Constitutional Spec Kit Amendments: Vanilla to CODOR Compliance

**Generated**: September 29, 2025  
**Source Analysis**: GitHub Spec Kit (vanilla) vs CODOR Amended Prompts  
**Purpose**: Document constitutional compliance amendments for spec-to-implementation pipeline

## Overview

The vanilla GitHub Spec Kit provides excellent spec-driven development workflow but lacks constitutional compliance enforcement. Our amendments transform it into a constitutionally compliant implementation pipeline that prevents AI agent hallucination and ensures production-grade quality.

## Key Constitutional Amendments

### Amendment 1: Mandatory Validation Gates

**Vanilla GitHub Spec Kit**:
```markdown
- [ ] T008 User model in src/models/user.py
- [ ] T009 UserService CRUD in src/services/user_service.py
```

**CODOR Amendment**:
```markdown
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test GET /api/quotes in packages/web/tests/contract/quotes-get.test.ts
  - Evidence: evidence/T004/ with failing test results, contract test coverage
  - MCP: Browser test quote list API endpoint with network tab validation
  - Validation: node .specify/tools/pre-task-check.js T004
  - Completion: node .specify/tools/post-task-validation.js T004
```

**Impact**: Every task now requires constitutional compliance validation before and after execution.

### Amendment 2: Three-Gate Validation System

**Vanilla**: Task completion based on developer assertion
**CODOR**: Mandatory 3-gate validation system:

1. **Pre-Task Gate**: `pre-task-check.js` validates prerequisites
2. **MCP Gate**: Browser testing evidence with screenshots and interaction logs  
3. **Post-Task Gate**: `post-task-validation.js` with constitutional compliance checking

**Impact**: Prevents task completion without proper validation evidence.

### Amendment 3: Evidence-First Development Protocol

**Vanilla**: No evidence requirements
**CODOR**: Comprehensive evidence collection:

```markdown
## Constitutional Enforcement (MANDATORY)
**CRITICAL**: ALL tasks below are protected by Constitutional Amendments 1-3:
- Evidence Directory: Create evidence/[taskId]/ with required artifacts
- MCP Browser Testing: **REQUIRED** for ALL UI functionality - no exceptions
- **ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL**: NO task completion marking [x] without validation evidence
```

**Impact**: Forces agents to collect demonstrable proof of functionality.

### Amendment 4: Production Fraud Detection Integration

**Vanilla**: Basic linting and testing
**CODOR**: Battle-tested fraud detection tools:

- `constitutional-checker.js` - Validates completion claims against evidence
- `mcp-evidence-validator.js` - Validates browser testing artifacts
- `constitutional-audit.js` - Comprehensive compliance auditing
- `pre-task-check.js` - Pre-execution validation
- `post-task-validation.js` - Post-execution validation

**Impact**: 100% fraud detection rate against AI agent circumnavigation attempts.

### Amendment 5: MCP Browser Testing Requirements

**Vanilla**: Optional testing
**CODOR**: Mandatory MCP browser testing:

```markdown
- MCP: **REQUIRED** - Browser test all quote actions (Edit, Duplicate, Convert, Archive) with interaction logging
- MCP: **REQUIRED** - Browser test quote edit navigation with page transitions
- MCP: **REQUIRED** - Browser test filtering UI with multiple filter combinations
```

**Impact**: Every UI component must demonstrate actual browser functionality.

## Comparative Analysis

### Vanilla GitHub Spec Kit Workflow
1. `/specify` - Create specification
2. `/plan` - Generate implementation plan  
3. `/tasks` - Create task breakdown
4. `/implement` - Execute tasks
5. Basic completion validation

### CODOR Constitutional Workflow  
1. `/specify` - Create specification
2. `/plan` - Generate implementation plan with constitutional checks
3. `/tasks` - Create constitutionally compliant task breakdown
4. **Pre-task validation** for each task
5. **Evidence collection** during implementation
6. **MCP browser testing** for UI tasks
7. **Post-task validation** with 3-gate system
8. **Constitutional audit** before completion

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure Amendments

**Vanilla**:
```

├── scripts/
└── memory/
```

**CODOR**:
```
.specify/
├── templates/ (amended with constitutional enforcement)
├── scripts/ (enhanced with validation tools)  
├── tools/
│   ├── constitutional-checker.js
│   ├── pre-task-check.js

```

### Prompt Amendments Summary

| Original File | Amendment Type | Key Changes |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| `tasks.prompt.md` | Constitutional Enforcement | Added mandatory validation gates, evidence requirements |
| `implement.prompt.md` | Anti-Hallucination | Added pre/post-task validation, MCP testing requirements |
| `plan.prompt.md` | Constitutional Checks | Enhanced constitution compliance validation |
| `tasks-template.md` | Evidence Requirements | Added evidence directories, MCP testing specifications |

## Success Metrics

### Vanilla Spec Kit Limitations
- No fraud detection capabilities
- Task completion based on assertion
- No evidence collection requirements
- Basic constitutional compliance

### CODOR Constitutional Success Rates
- **100% fraud detection** (52 screenshot fraud attempts detected)
- **0% false task completions** (T004 case study: 15/15 tests, 4KB+ evidence)
- **Production-grade validation** (392-line documentation, complete artifacts)
- **Constitutional compliance** (3-gate validation system)

## Integration with CODOR 3.3

This amended Spec Kit serves as **Layer 2** of the CODOR framework:

1. **Layer 1**: Core Constitutional Framework (CODOR 3.3)
2. **Layer 2**: Spec-to-Implementation Pipeline (Amended GitHub Spec Kit) ← **This Document**
3. **Layer 3**: VS Code Integration (Enhanced Copilot Instructions)

The amended prompts ensure that every feature specification automatically generates constitutionally compliant tasks with built-in fraud detection and evidence collection requirements.

## Conclusion

The constitutional amendments to GitHub Spec Kit represent a breakthrough in preventing AI agent hallucination during development workflows. By integrating:

- **Mandatory validation gates**
- **Evidence-first development**  
- **Three-gate validation system**
- **Production fraud detection tools**
- **MCP browser testing requirements**

We've created the missing bridge from feature specifications to constitutional compliance, ensuring that AI agents cannot circumvent quality requirements while maintaining development velocity.

This system has been battle-tested through the T004 case study and demonstrates 100% fraud detection rates while enabling successful constitutional compliance achievement.
